### Your project idea 
#### Austin Attractions
Having just moved to Austin, TX, I want to build an app that lists the top attractions and things to do here. Each attraction will have a photo you can click on, which will take you to a detail page describing that attraction, along with comments from users. 

### MVP
- User can visit 
- 

### Stretch Goals
- User can login using 

### Front-end
- Planning to use EJS

### List of Mongoose models and their properties



### List of Routes


### User stories
- As a user, I'd like to view all Austin attractions so I can see what there is to do in the area
- As a user, I'd like to view a details page for each attraction so I can see all the information about a given activity
- As a user, I'd like to view comments about each attraction from other visitors so I can prioritize which attractions I'd like to visit
- As a user
